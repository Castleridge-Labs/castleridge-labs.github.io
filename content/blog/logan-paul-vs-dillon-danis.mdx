[Logan Paul](https://www.fite.tv/fighter/logan-paul/11870/) is making his boxing comeback by facing
[Dillon Danis](https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4316376/dillon-danis) on the KSI vs. Tommy Fury card on Oct. 14 in Manchester.
This marks Paul's return to the ring after his exhibition bout with Floyd Mayweather in 2021.
Despite his recent focus on WWE and collaborations with KSI, Paul and Danis, both social media influencers turned boxers,
will headline a marquee event together. Danis, a former grappling champion and Bellator fighter, will make his return to
combat sports after over four years. The event also includes the KSI vs. Tommy Fury fight and will be broadcast live
on DAZN pay-per-view in the US.

Sharing his anticipation for the event on Instagram, Paul stated,

> "October 14 I return to boxing after fighting Floyd Mayweather over two years ago.
> I doubt this little parasite will show up but if he does I'm going to erase him from existence."

Disregarding Paul's WWE endeavors, Danis declared,

> "I couldn't care less what Logan Paul has done in the WWE, because when he is in the boxing ring,
> he is in a completely different world. It's a world of pain, a world where he doesn't have control and it's my world, not his.
> On October 14, in Manchester, Logan Paul is getting beat down."

The Paul vs. Danis spectacle will share the limelight with the KSI vs. Fury showdown, all set to unfold at the AO Arena in Manchester,
with the live broadcast available via DAZN pay-per-view in the United States.
