UFC President Dana White has responded to Stephen Thompson's claim that he wasn't paid for UFC 291 due to his opponent missing weight.
Thompson made weight for his scheduled fight, but his opponent, Michel Pereira, didn't meet the weight limit. Thompson
chose not to compete and explained his decision was based on health and competitive risks. White explained that fighters
don't get paid to not fight and clarified the compensation process. He mentioned that Thompson will receive some form of compensation,
which might cover his training camp expenses. The UFC also offered Thompson another fight opportunity. While Thompson hadn't received
his show money yet, discussions were ongoing, and White assured that the matter would be resolved before Saturday.

> “You don't fight, you don't get paid, necessarily, in the contract. But we always make sure that we take care of everybody.
> We're working it out with 'Wonderboy' right now.
> It's all being worked out behind the scenes and this should all be worked out by Saturday.”
