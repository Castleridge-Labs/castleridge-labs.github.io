A U.S. judge in Nevada has granted class-action status to a group of over 1,200 martial arts 
fighters who are suing the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) for alleged wage suppression. The fighters 
claim that UFC's parent company, Zuffa, utilized its market dominance to hinder competitors 
and enforced exclusive contracts to retain fighters within the organization. The lawsuit asserts 
that the UFC paid fighters only 20% of its event revenues, significantly lower than the compensation
provided in other major sports like boxing. The damages sought in the class-action suit range between 
$811 million and $1.6 billion. The court ruling allows the case to move forward, while the UFC plans to 
challenge the certification order through an appeal. The court has also scheduled a status conference 
for August 21, with no trial date currently set.
